###  Short Intro

I'm an AI Engineer with hands-on experience building **multi-agent LLM systems, advanced RAG architectures, and scalable backend pipelines**.  
Currently pursuing a **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence (BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg, Germany)** while working on real world agentic automation systems.

My mission → build production-ready AI that **thinks, reasons, and executes — not just responds.**

###  What I'm Working On

-  Multi-Agent Conversational Systems using LangGraph & CrewAI  
-  Production-Grade RAG Evaluation & MLOps Observability  
-  LLM-as-Judge Frameworks and Model Tracing Pipelines  
-  Self-refining A2A agents + automation for legal workflows  
-  Exploring reflexive reasoning, tool-calling, MCP and autonomous AI loops
-  Object detection and tracking using yolo v8
-  Temporal learning algorithms
-  Fine-tuning LLM's using RLHF

###  Fun Fact & Interests

Outside of code — I’m human too. 😄  

💧 I swim regularly  
🥾 Love hiking & long nature walks  
📸 Photography is therapy  
✈️ I travel to explore cultures  
🍳 Sometimes I cook better than I code  
💻 And yes — I break code just to fix it cleaner
